# Short-Term-Prediction-of-COVID-19

The outbreak of Covid-19 was started in mid-December, 2019 from Wuhan, China. It was a pandemic which changed human’s livelihood and impacted millions of lives 
regressively. Not only business but the entire world got affected due to its it’s sudden walkthrough. The WHO was declared a health emergency on 30th Jan 2020 throughout 
the globe. 

In this crisis, AI helped as a long period technology and Innovation in IT played a vital role by inculcating things at a normal pace. Information Technology helped in 
imparting the total number of cases with proper statistics with the help of data science. Artificial Intelligence, a subset of data science, came as a revolution in this 
pandemic situation to synthesize virtual communication at best, these technologies are data mining, cloud orientation, machine learning, and deep learning. Thus, 
Estimating the covid outbreak becomes a debatable concern. The prediction of the Covid-19 pandemic plays a vital role in forecasting the likelihood of its rise can be 
done by using historical data of covid -19 statistics based on different features and attributes. In this project, I will use some machine learning algorithms such as 
linear regression, classification, etc. based on feature selection of the labels of the dataset to predict the severity of pandemic in the future. 

ML approaches are used and there will be mainly two solutions, one for predicting the chances of a number of infected people in near future and other for analyzing the 
number positive cases, cured and no of deaths. Through this prediction, one can able to predict the chances of its impact on different kinds of demographic data and its 
probability of getting infected provided by the people of different places. That’s why in a nutshell, taking the help of data analytics based on ML classification and 
regression using different modules to classify and predict the covid-19 outbreak. Then, the resulted models and techniques can be used for forecasting diseases that can 
make things easier to fight against this pandemic by taking corrective measures.

Using these tools, we will also help others to understand to not only fight against Covid-19 but also against any other virus outbreaks that may happen or occur in the 
future.
